## Overview

## Conversions

Write the following decimal numbers in their unsigned binary, hex, and octal representations. Put your answers in the text file named `conversions.txt` in
the repl.it workspace.

- 255
- 64
- 42
- 111

Tip: remember that each hex digit can be thought of as four binary digits. Each octal digit can be thought of as three binary digits.

## Sums

Convert the following decimal sums into their **8-bit two's complement representations**. Perform the sum using binary arithmetic, then
(for the problems with non-zero results) convert the result back from two's complement to decimal to show that your answer is correct. Put your
answers in the text file named `sums.txt` on the repl.it workspace.

- `20 + -20`
- `100 + -50`
- `-100 + 50`
- `77 + - 55`
