# What is the Pirate's Favorite Programming Language?

You'd think it would be R, but his first love is the C.

This assignment is all about getting comfortable writing basic C programs in the online environment. Instructions are as follows:

- Use the link that I sent by e-mail to join our class teamspace on Replit

- Once you're in the team, you can load the workspace for Assignment 1. Do all of your work for this assignment in that workspace. **Do not put your homework solutions in the workspace you use for in-class examples**. I won't be able to see them there.
